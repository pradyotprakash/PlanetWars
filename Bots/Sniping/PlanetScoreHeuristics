		assume that the heuristic strength of my planet depends on the following factors:
		  (i) number of ships presently on the planet
		  (ii) growth rate
		  (iii) friendly ships present around the planet
		  		(a) their distance
		  		(b) their strength
		  		(c) their growth rate

		  		In essence, a function of the following form:
		  			       a                        -----------
		  			x = ------- + b*strength + c* \/growth rate  
		 			    distance                  
			(iv) enemy ships present around the planet
				a function similar to part (iii) but with different constants
				Let's call the value 'y'.
			(v) number of inbound enemy fleets
			(vi) number of inbound friendly fleets
